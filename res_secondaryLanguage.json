The project employed a PostgreSQL database and was subsequently deployed on a production server. This encompassed the creation of multiple Django apps, managed through Git version control. The customization of Django admin, along with adept database schema design, models, and migrations, ensured seamless user experiences. Implementing search functionality enriched user interactions. Robust user authentication mechanisms were implemented, including options for Facebook and Google login. Lastly, email communication was integrated, completing the project's comprehensive features and functionalities :)",
